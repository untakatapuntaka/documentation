## Issues

> :warning: In order to make an effective contribution, please avoid any topic related to the Apple & Google protocol. These are considered to be beyond the scope of the current implementation. :warning:

Browse the issues section and use the search functionality to discover whether the issue you encountered has already been filed by someone else.
- If this is the case, please avoid opening a new issue. Instead, you can add more information to the existing issue. If the appropriate information is already present, you can add the :+1: symbol to the first message. Doing so helps the developers to identify and prioritize the relevant issues. Otherwise, add a comment with the relevant information.
- If this is not the case, please proceed with opening an issue.

Please consider opening an issue only if its content is relevant to this specific project.

When an issue is opened, a `triage` label is automatically assigned. The project’s [maintainers](#maintainers) are automatically notified of the issue's creation—they endeavour to address all issues as quickly as possible. When the issue has been triaged, a corresponding label will be assigned. Please see all the possible [labels](#labels).

## Pull Requests

After opening an issue, you may want to help the project further. If the issue has been triaged and if the project maintainers give the green light, you may propose a solution. Doing so is always appreciated. For this, please use the Pull Request tool.

> :warning: Before proceeding, ensure that an issue relevant to your proposal has already been opened and reviewed. :warning:

The first step in opening a `pull request` is to `fork` the project. Please log in to your account, then select Fork in the repository's landing page. This allows you to work on a dedicated fork and push your changes there. Then, if you wish to apply these changes back in the main Immuni repository, create a pull request targeting the main branch of this repository. For more detailed information, please read this [this](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) guide.
